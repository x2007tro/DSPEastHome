One day, I ran into Jason in the office kitchen (Jason and I work together), the guy said, "Hey, Ke! We are trying to start a Data Science Practitioners Community in Atlantic Canada. Are you interested?" My response was "Hell yeah!" This is basically where I began this amazing journey. Until now, I had so much fun sharing ideas with Thomas and Jason during work and exchanging thoughts with Casey (my wife) at home. I still remember the day when Thomas pitched me the idea of applying a random forest model on one project I was working on, I then realize how great it is if we can all share.

As an Actuary, I deal with complex models everyday. The moment I ran into predictive models, I immediately realize how these models can help me with my daily work. Even though the algorithms were not newly invented, the modern computer power really accelerated the growth of the application. I eagerly want to be a part of this growth. 

I know we have a great number of people who are interested in this rapid growing field in Fredericton. No matter if you are an expert, or you simply want to learn more about data science, I encourage you to join us. As an individual, we might not be as strong, but together we can truly do great things!
